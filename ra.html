        What is this law?
      </h1><br>
      <p style="padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px;">
        RA 10586 or the Anti-Drunk and Drugged Driving Act of 2013 is a law that was written/created
        by Senator Vicente C. Sotto III and it states that
        "the State shall penalize the acts of driving under the influence of alcohol, 
        dangerous drugs and other intoxicating substances and shall inculcate the standards 
        of safe driving and the benefits that may be derived from it through institutional 
        programs and appropriate public information strategies". This means the law will punish anyone
        who is caught driving while not being mentally safe to do so.

        10 Hurt as Drunk Driver Hits Vehicles, and a Pharmacy
      </h1><br>
      <p style="padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px;">
        The driver, Bryan Chua Tan was driving his Toyota Innova (NDU-7654) along Camarin Road in Barangay 
        174 when he hit a Mitsubishi Adventure and caused a chain reaction causing multiple other damages. 
        According to earlier reports, the incident in Caloocan occurred after Tan allegedly tried to escape 
        after he hit three cars in Quezon City. These reports stated that Tan admitted to being drunk while 
        driving, but that he insisted his car’s brakes had failed. Tan, who is currently detained at the 
        Caloocan police’s traffic office, faces charges of reckless imprudence resulting in multiple physical 
        injuries and damage to property, as well as driving under the influence of liquor or narcotic drug.
