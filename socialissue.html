        What is this social issue?
      </h1><br>
      <p style="padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px;">
        Drunk driving is when someone drives a vehicle under the influence of
        alcohol, dangerous drugs, or other similar substances, but in this topic,
        we'll focus more on alcohol since it is the most common. When the driver
        intakes alcohol or other beverages that makes a person incapable of driving
        a vehicle, there is a big possibility of that person endangering the life of
        others or his own. When a person drinks alcohol, the mind becomes dizzy and
        the person is not able to think or act normally, therefore causing that
        person to be unable to focus on driving and possibly lead to misfortunes.

      <h1 id="how" style="padding-top: 50px; padding-left: 50px;">How is this related to Gluttony?</h1>
      <p style="padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px;">
        As we already know, gulttony is a habitual greed or excess in eating or drinking. 
        People have the freedom to buy and drink alcohol in any time they want as long as 
        theyre above the age of 18 years old. Anyone (except minors) can drink alcohol 
        anywhere after they drive or if they're not planning on driving any time soon. Even 
        with all this time, people still choose to drink during or right before driving. 
        This is related to gluttony as this is an unhealthy obssession of a drink which 
        can easily be accessed and consumed in less dangerous times.

        What can you do to avoid this?
      </h1><br>
      <p style="padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px;">
        In order for you, the reader, to avoid such mistakes/accidents, we are
        going to tell you things you can do to avoid this.
      </p><br>
      <ol style="padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px;">
        <li>Always choose someone who does not drink often to drive</li>
          <p>
            People who don't drink often tend to have more control and are more
            responsible than people who drink a lot. This means that these people can
            be trusted in driving a vehicle when it comes to being drunk or not.
          </p><br>
        <li>When going out alone, never get alcoholic drinks, only water or soda.</li>
          <p>
            When going out alone, there is noone who can drive for you or even help
            you if you get drunk. If you don't have anyone with you, nobody is there
            to take care of you when you want to go home or in case something happens. 
            It's always better to just avoid getting drunk altogether in order to avoid
            any risk. 
          </p><br>
        <li>If you plan on drinking, please do so responsibly.</li>
          <p>
            When you really want/need to, then please be responsible and know exactly
            when and where to drink. It's important to control ourselves and only
            drink heavy drinks when you are sure you won't be doing anything big and difficult
            like driving. Better yet, only drink small amounts of alcohol in order to
            avoid getting drunk.
          </p><br>
        <li>Never get in a vehicle with a drunk driver</li>
          <p>
            If you know that the driver of a vehicle is drunk, its better to just avoid them
            and not get in the car with them. You can never predict when a person makes a
            mistake. Much more when that person is drunk. If the drunk driver is your friend
            or a person you know, tell them to get out of the vehicle and wait until they're
            feeling better and is okay to drive a vehicle.
          </p><br>
      </ol>

      <p style="padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px;">
        People have been warned countlessly already about the dangers of driving when not feeling
        too well. For some reason, after drinking alcohol, people still force themselves to drive 
        and risk people getting hurt, including themselves. Drunk drivers have gotten into accidents, 
        injuries, or car crashes that have spilt the red blood of the innocent that don’t even know 
        what was happening until they get affected by the accident.<br><br>
        Wine and alcohol have been known to be present even during the time of the Greeks where there 
        were parties, celebrations, important events that have beer and wine. These 2 beverages have 
        been known to affect Zeus, God of the Skies and Lightning’s decisions and actions. The decisions 
        the god made when he was drunk where nothing short of terrible and irresponsible choices.<br><br>
        In the Philippines, though not too frequently, still experience car accidents which include 
        the driver not being mentally stable due to intake of alcohol. According to Acta Medica 
        Philippina, 12,000 road users die annually due to road crashes and 1/3 of them are due to 
        alcohol-related issues. This is a scary amount, and the number of deaths will only keep getting 
        bigger unless we do something about it.
